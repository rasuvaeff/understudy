# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Initial engine: interface doubles generated from Reflection, the sentinel
  recording mechanism behind the call-closure API, `when()` with
  `returns()`/`throws()`/`answers()`, `verify()` with count bounds,
  `Understudy::calls()`, `unused()`, `label()`, loose and strict modes,
  type-safe loose defaults, recorded call outcomes, and failure messages that
  mark the argument that differed.
- Expectation ledger with `expect()`, cardinality, chained actions, ordered
  expectations, `nothingElse()`, `allVerified()`, exact cross-double
  `verifySequence()`, transcripts, checkpoints, and nested scopes.
- Fiber-local runtime contexts with owner-routed normal calls, context-bound
  configuration and verification, scoped-double invalidation, and reset of
  only the current execution context.
- Compatible multi-interface signature unification, including contravariant
  parameters, covariant and synthesised intersection return types,
  deterministic primary-interface parameter names, and safe handling of
  `mixed` and static contract methods.
